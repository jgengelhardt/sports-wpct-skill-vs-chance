# Estimating Win% Variance Attributable to Skill
How well do season win percentages represent team skill (rather than chance) in various competitive sports leagues?

<!-- ## Background -->

## Collection
### NHL
Collecting NHL historical season data is simple using the [official NHL API](https://records.nhl.com/site/api/franchise-season-records), though only [unofficial documentation](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi) exists. To reduce the number of requests sent to their servers, my script requests franchise data from all previous NHL seasons once, then organizes it into seasons, rather than requesting each of the 100+ past seasons separately.

### NBA
There is an [API client](https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/) for NBA.com, but I noticed that many people scrape [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), which presents data from [Sportsradar](https://sportradar.us/) (an official stats partner of the NBA) in simple-to-parse tables, so that's what I did.

## Transformation
The key equation is ````var(x+y) = var(x) + var(y) + 2*Cov(x,y)```` as ````var(record) = var(skill) + var(luck)````, where ````var(record)```` is the variance of the teams' wins out of games played, and ````var(luck)```` is the variance we would expect for randomly determined outcomesâ€”for example, if teams just flipped a coin to determine the outcome of each match. We will work with the assumption that skill and luck are mutually independent, so the the covariance ````Cov(x,y)```` between skill and luck is 0. In general, greater variance suggests the outcomes better represent team skill.

## Visualization
With the season year on the horizontal axis and the number representing how well a season's final standings represent team skill on the vertical axis, it's possible to find a trend line for the role of skill in season standings over time for a given league. We can compare those trends at a glance to determine which league's standings have been more likely to represent team skill.
