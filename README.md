# Estimating Win% Variance Attributable to Skill
How well do season win percentages represent team skill (rather than chance) in various competitive sports leagues?

<!-- ## Background -->

## Collection
### NHL
Collecting NHL historical season data is simple using the [official NHL API](https://records.nhl.com/site/api/franchise-season-records), though only [unofficial documentation](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi) exists.

## Transformation

The key equation is ````var(x+y) = var(x) + var(y) + 2*Cov(x,y)```` as ````var(record) = var(skill) + var(luck)````, where ````var(record)```` is the variance of the teams' wins out of games played, and ````var(luck)```` is the variance we would expect for randomly determined outcomesâ€”for example, if teams just flipped a coin to determine the outcome of each match. We will work with the assumption that skill and luck are mutually independent, so the the covariance ````Cov(x,y)```` between skill and luck is 0. In general, greater variance suggests the outcomes better represent team skill.
